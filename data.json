Our goal is to ensure that computing has a net positive impact on the world, and our research typically lies at the intersection of social computing, spatial computing, and human-computer interaction. We have particular expertise in (1) understanding the relationships between algorithms and society and (2) building technologies to improve those relationships.\n","news":["Jan 2018: Ph.D. students Allen and Isaac head off to research internships at Microsoft and Google, respectively.","Dec 2017: New WWW paper accepted.","Dec 2017: Five new ACM SIGCHI papers accepted.","Sept 2017: Nick and Hanlin formally join us as Ph.D. students!","Aug 2017: Three new ACM CSCW papers accepted.","June 2017: Brent selected as Chair of ACM Future of Computing Academy"],"projects":[{"name":"Tweet Geolocation","image":"/static/geolocation.png","description":"Bias in social-media-based algorithms derives not just from population biases in the underlying data but also from structural biases in the design of algorithms."},{"name":"Routing Algorithmic Externalities","image":"/static/routing_externalities.png","description":"Changes to fastest-path vehicle routing (e.g. incorporating notions of scenic-ness, safety, or simplicity) could have unintended side-effects both individually on the routes and in aggregate on neighborhoods."},{"name":"Death by GPS","image":"/static/deathbygps.png","description":"Driving accidents attributed to problems with GPS navigation derive from a wide variety of sources such as the failure to recognize driver context in suggesting routes and map-matching algorithms."}],"opportunitiesText":"\nWe are currently looking for students excited about doing work at the intersection of human-computer interaction, spatial computing, and social computing.
